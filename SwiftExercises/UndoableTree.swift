/// A tree that has undo and redo operations. Note that extending
/// Tree would be dangerous. This is a classic fragile-base-class
/// problem. The current class must provide versions of add() and
/// remove(), and those methods chain to the associated Tree methods,
/// but they also do a bit more undo-related work. If we had subclassed
/// Tree, and then at some future date added another variant of add()
/// to the Tree class, we would probably not override that other variant,
/// here. That would put us into the position of blowing up if we tried
/// to do an undo on a field that was added using that new variant of add(),
/// because the extra undo-related work would not have been done by the
/// new variant.
///
/// Solve the problem by implementing Collection and then *use* a tree
/// to store the data.
